This directory contains code for generating 3D, spatially and temporally binned image arrays of NuSTAR solar data.
In addition, there are scripts to calculate pixel variability and derive the instrument sensitivity to flares of 
specific temperature and flux normalization (emission measure) values (for a specific observation). In this directory the scripts are applied to quiet Sun observations on 2014-Nov-01, though they can (and will) be readily generalized to other observations. 

NuSTAR quicklook images and light-curves from the 2014-Nov-01 can be seen on Iain Hannah's summary page here:

I am still in the process of documenting this code.
